It's 2022 and if you haven't started investing, consider this your sign to begin your investing journey. "Investing" is a broad word, and it means when you buy or somehow get assets with the goal of storing or increasing your wealth.

An example of an investment is when you own a cow - the cow "stores" your meat and leather for the day you are ready to slaughter, and it grows over the years as you feed and take care of it. Furthermore, when your cow gives you calves, that's your investment multiplying (or compounding). Alternatively, instead of storing your meat and leather, your cow could be a monetary investment when you sell it for more than it cost you to get and/or raise it.

As much as you can get or inherit assets such as cows, blueberry bushes, cryptocurrencies, solar energy or even money, you can also get part-ownership in existing companies like Astral Foods (which makes Goldi Chicken) and Mr Price Group. Since you'll only have part-ownership, you are sharing the company's ownership, so your part of the company is represented as shares. Also, you can only buy shares in publicly listed companies, which means their shares are available for purchase by public individuals like us on an exchange like the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).

The sum total of all your assets is your portfolio. When you have many different kinds of assets, your portfolio is diverse. But suppose you only have cows as an investment (this would be known as a concentrated portfolio). In that case, you are at risk of losing your whole portfolio if your cows are stricken by disease or stolen. The act of adding more variety to the kinds of assets you have in your portfolio is known as diversifying. If something happens to one or a few of your assets - you'll still have many others to fall back on when your portfolio.

Start your investing journey by collecting or buying assets that you understand. Then expand your horizons by learning about other kinds of investments and how you can effectively get them too to diversify your portfolio.

All the best with your investing journey!
