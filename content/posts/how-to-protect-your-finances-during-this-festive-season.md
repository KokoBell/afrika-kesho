One of the best ways to protect yourself from scams is to know what they are. Cons are everywhere, and they can be tough to spot. When you're looking for a new job, buying a home or just trying to make ends meet, it's easy to get overwhelmed by financial stress.

That's when scammers step in and offer a solution — but it's not one that benefits you. Becoming a victim will probably leave you going through quite a sour holiday period, so let’s dive into ways to spot and avoid potential scams.

## [](<>)Be aware of the tactics scammers use

When making financial decisions, taking note of your emotional state before committing to anything is essential. People with bad intentions can take advantage of your vulnerable state when you feel scared, rushed, or confused. For example, scam emails can trick you into accidentally sharing sensitive information by crafting a scary situation like a false account deletion request.

Another, more practical example would look like this:

## [](<>)Understand the basic structure of a pyramid scheme

Often if the scam in question is in the form of a pyramid scheme such as MMM years ago or WhatsApp stokvel recently, then there are some things they’ll have in common that you can spot from a mile away:

1. You buy a product or service
2. You sell it to others
3. You recruit people to do the same

If most of the money is made in recruitment, you are likely dealing with a pyramid scheme.

## [](<>)If it’s too good to be, it probably is

I cannot emphasize this enough, but if someone is explaining a product, investment or idea to you and you feel excited, do not agree to anything before you can calm down and think clearly. Ask yourself questions like, how reasonable does this sound? Where would they be getting the money from? If they could make that money for themselves, why are they involving me? If I send them any money, what safety measures are there that can protect or return my money? And so on.

## [](<>)Trust but verify

Even if an “investment opportunity” comes from a friend you trust, always research the information you are receiving and fact-check everything. Sometimes the people you know can lead you astray, even when they have the best intentions.

## [](<>)Refer to official channels

Each country has a relevant authority to register to offer financial services. In the case of South Africa, there is the *[Financial Sector Conduct Authority](https://www.fsca.co.za/Pages/Default.aspx)*, which can help you verify the registration of the company you intend to do business or investments with and check which products and services they are licensed to offer you. It is illegal for a company that is only licensed to do money markets to offer commodities - and an unlicensed company cannot accept your money as an investment.
