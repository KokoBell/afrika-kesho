Money helps us do so many things in life — such as travelling or buying things for your friends and family, even healthcare — but if you don't know how to spend it wisely, or even handle having money at all, then it becomes a source of stress really quickly and consistently. That's why learning about money is so important — because what you believe about it affects what you do with it and how you do it.

In this article we will learn about our relationship with money: why we have one and what are some ways we can improve our relationship with it?

## [](<>)Where do your beliefs about money come from?

Your beliefs and values come from what you've been exposed to as you grow up. This includes your environment, random events, knowledge and past experiences.

A common mistake people make is thinking their beliefs are stable, permanent, or always the same. The opposite is true! Our beliefs are something we choose and we have the power to change them. Changing our beliefs can make our reality take a turn for the better.

If you change your beliefs about money, you'll likely feel differently about it. This can then either motivate or demotivate you to act differently with regard to your finances.

This means that it's important for us as humans, who are constantly changing beings, to be aware of our own thoughts and feelings about money so that we can make conscious decisions based on our values rather than automatically reacting from our subconscious programming around scarcity or abundance.

## [](<>)Does your current relationship with money align with the way you want to live?

If you answered no, it’s time to start getting clear on your relationship with money. Here are a few ways to get started:

1. Start by recognizing if your current feelings and beliefs about money are true or not. If they are not, start to think about what you want to believe and feel. What do you want your relationship with money to be? What is the ideal relationship that is most aligned with who you want to be?

2. Once you’ve gotten clear on who you want to be and what your ideal relationship is, start to put more effort into aligning your feelings and thoughts about money with that identity.

3. Consider doing this by working with a coach, therapist, or friend to help you get clear on your relationship and self with money. Take some time to reflect on the positive financial decisions you’ve made in your life so far. What are the qualities of the person that led you to those decisions? What has been your process for making them? Can you remember a time when you made a decision that was in alignment with your values and principles?

Once you have an identity and feelings about money aligned, you can begin to learn about money and how it works in order to meet your personal financial goals. However, understanding your relationship with money is always a good place to start when getting clear on where you want to go with the subject.

## [](<>)Is it possible we're living in a time of abundance and not scarcity?

We are conditioned to believe that the world is a zero-sum game. This means that for one person to get an extra R1000, another has to lose out on R1000. But in truth, the more you have, the more you can give — and that certainly extends to money as well as time and energy.

A more concrete example of abundance is the Earth itself, look around you’ll see nature growing even in the driest places.

The more you give of yourself and your resources in support of others' dreams and aspirations, your own vision will flourish as well! So if you want greater abundance in all areas of your life (including income), it's important not only to give but also receive with open arms anything that comes your way.

## [](<>)Can you still be generous if you have a scarcity mindset?

While you may assume that if you have a scarcity mindset, then you can’t be generous, this isn’t necessarily true. Generosity is about the mindset and not about how much money you have in your bank account.

In fact, many people who don’t make a lot of money are extremely generous with their time and energy—whether it’s volunteering at their local community garden or coaching their child’s soccer team.

There are many ways to be generous without spending any money at all:

* Give your time and energy to others without expecting anything in return (e.g., volunteer at an old age home)
* Gift your pre-loved (but useful) items
* Give someone a heartfelt compliment

## [](<>)How can you engage with money in the least stressful way possible?

What you need to do is stop thinking about money as a finite resource. Instead, try to remember that your relationship with money is one of abundance — that there's always more where this came from.

To help you get there, we recommend making small changes in how you think about and use money each day. Try these suggestions and see how it goes:

1. Separate money from feelings . The more emotional you get, the less in control of your money you'll be. Try to keep your emotions out of the equation and just focus on the facts — that there's always more where this came from.

2. Breathe. Focus on what needs to happen today. Don't obsess about what you want to happen in the future. The more you focus on what's happening now, the easier it will be to make the decisions you need to make today.

3. Take a break from counting . It's important that your money supply is manageable and within your control, but when it becomes too much of a burden, take some time off.

I know my friends who have less money than me are just as happy with their lives as those who make more. It all starts by changing the way we think about money and ourselves and our lives, because what we believe is going to determine how we act in any situation — and if we don't believe something is possible, then it won't be!

## [](<>)Conclusion

If you're someone who's been struggling with money, I hope this post has helped you see that it's not personal, and it's not necessarily your fault. Money is a social construct, and the way we view it is influenced by many factors, some of which are out of our control. Your relationship with money can be changed.
