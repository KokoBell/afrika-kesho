If you’ve been in the investing community for a while then you know that there’s a very common saying about eggs and baskets, but it all boils down to ‘diversification’. For those unfamiliar with the word, I break it down in the next paragraph - but if you already know the word then read on to refresh your memory and pick up one or two new things. Now…

## What is diversification?

Imagine there’s 2 neighboring farmers, Botshelo and Zonke. Botshelo only farms crops, while Zonke farms both crops and livestock. Ideally, Botshelo can sell her crops with no incident. However, if an unexpected event such as a crop disease happens, Botshelo might lose her entire business - what would happen to Zonke’s farm?

This illustrates diversification - reducing risk by splitting your assets across different characteristics. The assets and the characteristics can vary, like buying shares (asset) in different companies (characteristic).

## Why diversify

The goal is that no single event could leave you stranded in terms of financial security. Like if these unlikely scenarios occurred:

* If there’s a global crash of all stock markets, you would still have a house to live in
* If there’s you have to run away from your country, you have money in other currencies
* If one of the industries you invested in has a downturn, another might be in an upturn

And so on…

Although diversifying can be beneficial for your investments when you spread them across asset classes, geographies and timelines, let’s expand our view of diversification beyond investing.

## What can you diversify

#### Income

This is something I’m still in the process of building for myself, but having more than one income stream can do wonders for one’s financial stability. And taking it a step further is ensuring that the income streams are different types (royalties, dividends, salary, etc)

#### Social circle

Building strong and authentic relationships can give your happiness a boost. Being open to making friends and acquaintances can lead you to spaces you didn’t think you’d find yourself in. However, in the pursuit of new bonds, take care to nurture the bonds you already have with current friends and family.

#### Experiences

Life is too short not to have fun. So travel to different places, go to the movies, take a walk to new parts of your current town or play video games - just make sure you fill your heart and memory-bank.

 What else can you think of that we can diversify?

## The common characteristics of diversifying

Bringing back to investing and wealth-building, there are various factors you can use to split your portfolio:

* Asset classes (equities, property, bonds etc)
* Timelines (short term, medium term and long term)
* Geography (countries, continents etc)
* Sectors
* Industries
* Private/Public

## Some downsides to consider

You might have heard the saying “too much of a good thing is a bad thing”, well the saying applies to diversification. Too much diversification can lead to reducing your returns - at this point, it’s counterproductive. Reducing risk should not come at the cost of a significant portion of your returns.

Transacting with more assets can also increase your fees, so weigh the benefit vs the cost when making these decisions.

Furthermore, diversification is not a small task. It requires thorough research and understanding of each of the potential investments you are considering, over and above maintaining the diversification by rebalancing.

## Conclusion

Buying a diverse portfolio of assets allows you to control the risk of losing money. If one asset does poorly, then the other investments have a better chance to make up for it. Please let me know in the comments if you found this article helpful.
