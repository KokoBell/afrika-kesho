## General Overview

Knowing what investing is and having a general idea of how it works is a giant leap in the right direction – considering that most people in South Africa have no clue what investing is. However, knowing what it is does not entail knowing how to go about it. The information below aims to help you in the practical aspect of investing. Now that you have an investment account, what’s next? It’s time to construct your investment portfolio – which is the sum of the assets you invest in.

There are different asset classes that one can investigate when intending to invest. The focus will be on shares, commodities, ETFs, bonds and property. The methodology of how to choose what to invest in within these different asset classes will be discussed.

## Factors to Consider

#### Fees

You need to keep your eyes on fees throughout your investing journey. Fees impact your investments, in the long term this impact compounds. The three main types of fees you should consider are account fees, brokerage fees and spread.

* **Account Fees**: Account fees are the fees you pay for the privilege of having an account with the bank, broker or financial services provider you use to invest. Sometimes the cost is worth it. For example, the Standard Bank Online Share Trader platform is a comprehensive platform with a multitude of features including live share prices. If you plan to use the extra features, it might be worthwhile to pay the account fees. But, for the investor who wants the bare minimum, preference should be given to platforms such as Easy Equities that have no account fees.
* **Brokerage Fees**: When you transact in an investment account, be it buying ETFs, shares or anything of that sort, you are charged a fee for buying and selling. This is the amount it costs to process the transaction. It’s known as the brokerage fee and is generally represented as a percentage of the amount you’re investing. Some accounts have a brokerage fee that decreases for larger transactions whilst others charge a constant fee irrespective of the amount invested.
* **Spread**: The most misleading fee is spread. This is because it does not undertake the characteristics of a fee. The spread is defined as the difference between the selling price and the buying price. Excluding brokerage fees and share price fluctuations, if you bought and sold a share in the span of 1 second, you will most likely have less money than you started with. That’s because of the spread. Keep your eyes on the price! Make sure that the difference between the buying and sell prices are not unreasonably large.

Your annual tax-free contribution of R36,000 includes fees. Whenever you transact in your tax-free account, the brokerage fees are deducted from your contribution. This means that higher fees eat into your tax-free allocation, therefore, less of your money can grow tax-free. Lower fees are always better!

#### Risk Appetite

Risk is tied to two things – time and volatility. Time will be covered in the next point. Volatility is a measurement of how something, such as share price, fluctuates. Higher volatility implies higher risk.

Your appetite for risk is indicated by how you handle volatility. Would a share price jump of +13% get you over the moon? Would a subsequent -5% decline of the same share a day later give you sleepless nights? Or can you take those daily changes without as much as a wink from you? You need to do introspection and decide on how much volatility you can sanely tolerate. Knowing your risk appetite will allow you to allocate your capital in investments that you are comfortable with.

#### Time

Ask yourself: “When will I need to access this money?”

The question of time is vital to determine the kind of investments you will make and the vehicles in which to make them. If you want to save for retirement you can put your money in a retirement annuity. Alternatively, if you have money that you will not have to touch in 20+ years, you can put it in your tax-free savings account and let it grow in perpetuity. If you just need a place to park your money for a year or two then you can buy a bond or leave your money in an interest-bearing bank account (money market). The list goes on.

The type of investment is tied to time by risk. Volatility is the real tie. In the short term, equity (shares) are not great for parking your money. The market may crash the day before you were planning to sell your shares. Or the shares you bought might collapse. Furthermore, buying bonds for the long term is uneconomical. Equities give better returns in the long term, and inflation eats into your invested bond capital over the long term.

So, be conscious of how much time you have for your investments.

#### Goal

Setting specific goals and deadlines for your goals helps you decide where to put your money. If you would like to buy a car in the next 5 years, ask yourself what the best way to achieve that is. Could listed property give you the returns you are looking for? Or a bond? Or equity? If you want to save for your child’s education, or if you are trying to save for your own education, how would you go about it?

When you know what goals you are trying to achieve, you will make a more informed decision on what the best ‘tool’ for the job is. Diving in headfirst without having set goals is like buying tools to fix your bicycle without knowing exactly what is wrong with your bicycle – chances of success are very slim.

## Shares

Shares can be described as ownership of a company. When you buy shares, there are several things you need to look out for.

#### Non-technical things to look out for

Firstly, make sure you understand the company you are investing in. Do you know how they make money? Do you think they will continue to make money in the long run? Do you think they will increase their profits over time? And if so, how? These are things to consider since they affect the share price of a company. Also, look for longevity. A company that has been around for a long time is likely to remain around for even longer. This is not to say that you should disregard new companies – but be more cautious of them.

Secondly, familiarity should work to your advantage. Do you shop at Shoprite? Then consider investing in Shoprite, since you will be contributing to their profits. Being a customer also gives you an idea of their operations and therefore you know a bit more about the company. A word of warning though, do not go in blindly. Look up the management of the company, their credentials and the company’s business model if you can. Find out as much as you can about the company, look for characteristics that are fundamental to the company such as where they primarily operate – since this affects their profitability.

Thirdly, do not invest in companies that are all in the same industry. Imagine you buy shares in gold mining companies and the price of gold goes down by a significant amount. All the companies you invested in will decrease in share price, and therefore the value of your entire portfolio will decrease.

#### The technical factors to look at

There is a method in the investing world called Fundamental Analysis. This is when you analyze a company’s financial statements, competitors, health and markets. We will be primarily focused on the financial statements, or rather, condensed information from the financial statements which have been made readily available.

There are several factors to consider when analyzing a company, we will look at *Earnings per Share*, *Price to Earning’s Ratio*, *Price to Book Ratio*, *Dividend Payout Ratio*, *Dividend Yield* and *Return on Equity*. The information you need to calculate these values, if they have not been calculated already, is freely available on investing websites such as investing.com and SimplyWallStreet. Also, public companies themselves have to publish their financial statements, which is where you get the information you need to calculate these values.

* **Earnings per Share** (EPS): This is the net earnings divided by the outstanding shares. Wikipedia defines outstanding shares as “all the shares of a corporation or financial asset that have been authorized, issued and purchased by investors and are held by them.”
*  **Price to Earnings Ratio** (P/E): This is the current price of a share divided by the EPS of a company. It tells you whether the price of a company is overvalued, undervalued or fairly valued. You would compare the company’s P/E with the P/E’s of similar companies to get a sense of how the company is valued. You want your P/E to be reasonably low relative to the P/E of similar companies. When a P/E is too low it is a sign that something might be wrong with the company – or at least the market thinks so.
* **Price to Book Ratio** (P/B): The book value of a company is how much the company would be worth if it were to be liquidated today – that is, if the company closed down, its assets were sold, and its liabilities were paid off, how much money would be left over for the shareholders. The price to book value is calculated by dividing the current share price by the most recent book value. You are generally looking for a low P/B. If a P/B ratio is less than 1 (but greater than 0), it means the company is undervalued i.e. you are getting a discount for the shares.
* **Dividend Payout Ratio**: This ratio tells you how much of the profits the company keeps for cash reserves, debt repayment and the growth of the company, versus how much of the profits the company pays out to the shareholders. You calculate this value by dividing the dividend per share with earnings per share. This ratio is subjective, so is open to your own individual interpretation.
* **Dividend Yield**: This is the percentage of dividends compared to the share price that the company pays out to shareholders in a year. It is calculated by dividing the dividends paid out in a one-year period per share by the value of a share. If you are investing for income, you are looking for a high dividend yield. However, be cautious, since dividend yield can be misleading in some cases. The value of a share price can plummet, but the dividend remains the same, in this case, the dividend yield would sky-rocket, even though the dividend payout per share has not changed, or maybe has even decreased.
* **Return on Equity** (ROE): ROE is a measure of how efficiently a company uses its assets to make a profit. You calculate this by dividing the net income of the company by its book value. As with the P/E, this value works best when compared with that of similar companies.
* **Debt to Equity** (D/E): This ratio tells you how much debt a company has compared to its net assets. You are looking for a company with a low D/E because more debt makes a company more financially vulnerable.

## Bonds

Debt can be an investment. This investment comes in the form of bonds. There are a variety of bond issuers (the institutions whose bonds you would be buying), such as the government and the banks. Bonds are an alternative for institutions that do not want to seek bank loans.

When you buy a bond, you are borrowing that institution money. You get paid interest semiannually for a predetermined amount of time, after which you get your money back.

#### Features

Here are the features of a bond:

* **Face/Par Value**: this is the value that the issuer uses to calculate the interest. It is the amount that the bond will be worth at maturity.
* **Coupon Rate**: the interest payments of a bond are called coupons. The coupon rate is the interest rate. It is a percentage of the face value.
* **Coupon Dates**: these are the dates on which the bond issuer will make the coupon payments.
* **Maturity Date**: on the maturity date, the face value of the bond is paid back to you. It is when the bond is said to have “matured”.
* **Term**: the length of time from the issuing of the bonds to the maturity date.

#### Why would you want bonds in your portfolio?

The simple answer is: diversification. Bonds are a safer investment as opposed to shares. The price of bonds is less volatile, and the return is more predictable. In the case of a company being liquidated, bond-holders are higher on the priority list of getting paid back than shareholders. The disadvantage of bonds is that their price does not grow as much as the price of shares.

Due to the trade-off between risk and reward, a well-diversified portfolio usually has some exposure to bonds, so that when the share market is not doing well the bond income can be a counterbalance.

Governments can issue bonds through exchanges, just like companies, or they can issue bonds directly to the public. In South Africa, you can buy Retail Savings Bonds directly from the National Treasury, the South African Post Office, or Pick n Pay stores.

#### Here's a scenario

It is 2017 and the government needs R400 billion to cover Eskom’s debt and to restructure the grid to renewable energy, so they decide to gather that amount of money via bonds. They decide to issue 400 million bonds worth R1000 each. The term of the bond is 10 years. The coupon rate on this bond is 5%, which is split and paid semiannually.

In 2019, you decide that you need some bonds in your portfolio. You look around, and you find corporate, municipal and government bonds with coupon rates ranging from 3% to 4.5%. But then you stumble upon a unicorn whose coupon rate is 5%, it is the Eskom debt governments bonds. You realize that this bond has a relatively high coupon rate and it is from the government - meaning that they are unlikely to not pay you, and because the bond is still 8 years from maturity, coupled with the fact that the market interest rates have been increasing, the price of this bond is at R980. This is a discount compared to R1000.

In this scenario, and in any scenario, here are the factors that you should consider before buying the bond:

* Coupon rate
* Credibility and reliability of the bond issuer
* The price of the bond
* Market conditions
* Anticipated interest rate changes

## ETFs

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are one of many investment vehicles known as collective investment schemes. Collective investments schemes are just a mixture of different ingredients. The ingredients range from company shares, property shares, cash, bonds and commodities. These are mixed into one final product. When you buy a portion of this product, called a unit or a share, you are buying all the different ingredients that constitute the final product.\
ETFs are not the only collective investment schemes. There are others, like Unit Trusts. The focus will be primarily on ETFs.

#### ETFs track indices, but what is an index?

An index is a way of tracking the average share price of a group of companies on an exchange. It is usually represented visually by means of a graph. The graph shows you the fluctuations of the index as the share prices of the companies in the index change. Our most well-known and generic index is the Top 40 index. It tracks the 40 biggest companies on the JSE. And so, a Top 40 ETF would be an ETF that gives you the returns of the Top 40 index.

There are things you should look at when you are deciding which ETF to buy, namely:

* Fees
* Methodology
* Asset Classes

#### Fees

Fees are important to consider when buying ETFs. The fees applicable to ETFs include the total expense ratio (TER) and the total investment cost (TIC). If ETFs investments are the same in every way except fees, then the ETF with the lower fees will perform better.

The TER is the total expense ratio. This fee is represented as a percentage and is charged in the background. It is a perpetual fee, it is charged for as long as you hold the ETF. It is necessary for the ETF issuers to charge this fee because they must pay legal and auditing fees, market makers and ordinary business overheads like employees. Issuing and running an ETF costs money, therefore the ETF issuers must charge for this service.

When you compare similar ETFs, you should be biased towards the one with a lower TER. This is because the impact of the fees compounds. The danger with the TER is that you do not see it – you do not see your money walking out the door. When you earn dividends, the tax and TER are subtracted before the dividends ever get to you. This negates the impact of compounding because you have fewer dividends to reinvest.

The TIC, total investment cost, includes the asset management fee, TER, and other related expenses such as audit, trustee and custody charges. However, it does not include the brokerage fees.

Fortunately, ETFs save you a significant amount on brokerage fees. This is in comparison to if you had to buy the same number of stocks individually.

#### Methodology

The ETF methodology is the strategy that is implemented in the ETF to select the companies or their weighting. Methodologies can vary from market capitalization, equal-weighted, all the way to smart-beta. The information on the methodology of an ETF can be found in the ETF’s minimum disclosure document, which is given on the ETF issuer’s website. A consolidated list of ETFs and their information can also be found on etfsa.co.za.

As a rule, read the minimum disclosure document of an ETF before buying it. Make sure you understand the ETF and how it works and decide whether it can help you achieve the goals you have set.

#### Asset Classes

According to Vanguard’s document on portfolio construction, an asset is “an item of value, including bonds, stocks and other securities, cash, or physical items such as inventory, a house or a car.” Things like cars are actually not considered assets. Firstly, they depreciate. Secondly, unless you offer driving, delivery or similar services, cars do not directly make you any money.

Different assets behave in varying ways in different market conditions. For example, your offshore ETFs would be affected by the exchange rate. To construct your portfolio such that you make money all throughout the year and through different market conditions, you need to decide on how much of each asset you want in your portfolio. The younger you are, the more you would want to tilt your asset allocation towards equity.

The aim of a good asset allocation is that if one of your asset classes are in a loss-making state, then the money you are making in other assets more than compensates for the loss.

ETFs are an efficient way of getting multiple products at once within the same asset class, but furthermore, ETFs allow you to gain exposure to multiple asset classes at once.

## Commodities

The reason people invest in commodities is to have a sense of security. The idea of having a physical asset backing whatever financial commitment you made brings an air of comfort. In his wisdom, Simon Brown alludes to investing in wheat and corn as commodities, rather than gold and rhodium. That is if you choose to invest in commodities at all. While doomsday preppers might buy silver, Simon thinks that if the day were to ever come, people would be fighting for food rather than silver.

While it may be a good idea to be safe rather than sorry, it probably isn’t a good idea to be storing large volumes of gold at your home. With that said, commodity ETFs offer you access to physical assets without the risk of robbery.

Unfortunately, you cannot buy commodity ETFs in your tax-free account.

An alternative way to invest in commodities is to invest in companies that specialize in them.

Each commodity has its own characteristics. Consider these characteristics if you want to invest in commodities. For example, if you want to buy a rhodium ETF, you should understand what rhodium is and what it is used for. You should understand its behaviour in the market and the factors that influence that behaviour. You should know who buys the rhodium, and when the rhodium is in high demand. You should also understand the companies that deal with rhodium.

Commodity prices, and subsequently resources company share prices, tend to be cyclical. But, the cyclical behaviour itself is not constant, and that makes commodity prices extremely difficult to anticipate. This could be detrimental to your portfolio if you do not tread carefully in the commodities space. Another shortcoming of commodities is that they do not offer any income. The profit, if any, is purely from price movements. That means your portfolio could have lengthy bouts of stagnancy if the commodity prices do not rise, with no income to make up for the stagnancy.

## Property

Property may refer to an empty piece of land or to a building and the land on which it stands. You can physically buy buildings and other properties as an investment strategy, but that adds layers of complexity to your portfolio. You need a significant amount of starting capital to pull it off, as well as enough money to buy multiple properties in different areas to have a diversified portfolio. There is also the issue of maintenance and tenant management, the list of hurdles goes on.

The easier route to property investing is buying shares in property companies or buying real estate investment trusts. This lifts the responsibility of property management from you to the company – while getting the benefit of profit.

You may buy individual property companies, you would analyze these the same way you should any other company. But you would go a step further by trying to find out which properties the company manages, and whether you deem them profitable or not.

Look for property companies that have a diverse set of properties, from rental properties, retail, office and tourism, all the way to infrastructure sectors. You can invest in both local and international property. 

**Companies that rent out properties are appealing because that rental income is shared among investors, just like dividends in a normal company. These are great for income investors, who enjoy getting a regular income from their portfolios.**
