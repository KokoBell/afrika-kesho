Before you start investing, there are a few things you need to get in order to ensure that your investing journey goes smoothly and that your assets are protected. One thing that can get in the way of your investments is debt – when not used correctly it can erode the value of your money and sometimes even force you to exit your investments prematurely. For this reason, debt is number 1 on this list.

#### 1. Getting rid of debt

There are several well-known methods to manage debt effectively. For example, the snow-ball method and the avalanche method. The avalanche method involves paying off your debts in order of the highest interest to the lowest, while the snowball method includes paying them off in order of the size of the debt itself, from the smallest debt to the largest one. Pick the method that works best for you and apply it. There are also little things you can do to speed up the process, such as paying off more than your minimum required payments and using any extra money or “windfall” for the debt.

#### 2. Build an emergency fund

The justifications for having an emergency fund are many. Prime among those are that unexpected expenses can arise at any time, and having an emergency fund can help cover those without hurting your wallet (or getting into more debt). For investments, though, part of the reasoning is that when those emergencies do arise, you won’t have to sell your investments in order to cover your emergencies. Although it might take a while to build up, the recommended amount to have in your emergency fund is 6 months' worth of expenses, but more is better, of course.

#### 3. Increase your income

There is no one-size-fits-all method to increase your income, it all depends on your situation. Assess your situation and look for gaps in which you can increase your income. Some things one can try if their situation allows are:

* Negotiate for a raise at work
* Apply for a higher-paying job
* Start a side-hustle or business
* Try online jobs such as transcription and app testing in your spare time
* Teach people what you know for a fee (in person or online)

#### 4. Understand your spending

Check back on your bank statements from the previous couple of months and look at where your money is going and how it is being spent. If you have a budget, compare it with the bank statements to see if you actually stuck to it, and if not, why not? What can you change or do better next time? From there, decide how much you can afford to save, how much to invest and how much you want to spend on daily living and other expenses. Lastly, as a safety measure to ensure that you’re consistently investing - when your money comes in, set aside your saving and investing money FIRST, then spend the rest on your expenses.

#### 5. Map out your investment strategy

There are more than thousands of different kinds of investments, and having a clear strategy can help narrow down that number while trying to maximize profits. An investment strategy is a framework you use to decide which investments should be in your portfolio. Some of the considerations one has to look at when planning out their strategy are:

* What are your goals and priorities?
* What is your time horizon for each goal or investment?
* What kinds of assets could help you achieve your goals?
* How do you define the success of your strategy? How will you measure the success of your strategy?
* What are the potential risks of your strategy, and how can you minimize them?
* What effective strategies exist out there that you can incorporate into your own?

Ask yourself every possible question you can think of that’ll clarify your strategy. Review your plan regularly and make any necessary adjustments to stay in line with achieving your goals and the success you defined.

#### 6. Research your potential investments

After mapping out your strategy, which covers how you will build your overall portfolio, look at each asset that you’re about to include in your portfolio and try to understand as much as possible about it and whether it’ll be both safe and effective as an investment. Whether it’s a stock, a cryptocurrency or a stake in a farm etc. You might want to look into:

* What are the risks associated with this asset?
* How has it performed in the past? How could it perform in the future?
* What can interfere with the performance of that asset?
* What can help that asset perform better?

These are just some examples of the questions one could ask about each asset before they include it in their portfolio. Part of the research is also coming up with questions that’ll serve your purpose. All the best with your investing journey!
