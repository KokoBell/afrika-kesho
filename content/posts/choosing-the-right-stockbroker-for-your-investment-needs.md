## What is a stockbroker?

So, you've decided to jump on the investment bandwagon and start considering putting your money into a brokerage account. That's great! The first step is understanding the language of investments and how they can help you achieve your financial goals. Investing is a broad term, but it generally refers to trading stocks, bonds, mutual funds or other types of securities. In finance speak, a stockbroker is simply the person who buys or sells these assets for you in exchange for a commission (fee).

Now that we've clarified what a stockbroker does, let's discuss how the industry has evolved and what options are available to new investors.

## What is your investment strategy?

Before you sign up for an account, it's essential to decide what kind of investor you want to be. Are you a day trader with fingers on the pulse of buzzy companies at all times? Are you looking to invest over years or decades? Do you want to pay as little in fees and commissions as possible, even if it means limiting your investment options? Do you plan to keep close tabs on your investments, or do you trust that they'll grow over time without much attention from you?

These are important questions for every investor.

## Do you need advisory services?

You're on your own. Okay, so maybe it's not as dramatic as that. It’s just that the pool of advisors you can choose from is a bit more limited than the one for full-service brokers. But don't worry: there are still enough to satisfy the hungriest of investors (and keep you up at night wondering what to do).

It’s worth noting that many online brokerages now offer access to an advisor, even if they don't offer a traditional advisory service. These advisors can help you set goals and develop investment strategies to meet them, and they can also answer any questions you might have while using the platform—a win-win!

## What are the fees on the platform?

If you're still reading, you may be asking yourself, "Ok, but why do I care about these fees?" The answer is in your returns. They will eat into your interest earnings if you plan to invest long-term (we are talking retirement time). Make sure to compare them before signing up with any investment platform!

## In Closing…

Choosing the right investment platform can be the most critical part of your journey to financial freedom. There are a lot of platforms out there, and it can be hard to know which one is right for you! Let’s look at some criteria for choosing a platform that will work for you:

* Make a list of your investor needs. Write down your investment strategy and objectives, experience and level of involvement, fees, advisory services, etc.
* What do online reviews say about each platform? This will give you an indication of how reliable they are.
* Has the company been around long enough? Be wary if they haven’t yet weathered an economic storm.
* How easy is the interface to use? Can you quickly check your account status, or will you have to jump through hoops and wait on hold every time you want to see how much money you’ve made (or lost)?
