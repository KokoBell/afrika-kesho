Does thinking about the state of your finances give you an immediate headache? We all know the nightmare that personal finances can become, from keeping up with your budget, bills, debts, and accounts, it can escalate out of hand very quickly.

Now, imagine if you could sit back in your chair and be able to see every transaction that happens across all your accounts. Well, in this day and age, there’s an app for almost everything, so not only is that possible, but you can also keep track of your net worth in real-time.

Here are some apps that’ll bring the fun back into managing your money:

#### 22seven

[22seven](https://22seven.com/app/login) is a free budgeting and investing app from Old Mutual. The app helps you keep track of your money, create a personalized budget and study your money behaviour. What I find most impressive is the number of different accounts they support, including rewards programs like SmartShopper and Clicks ClubCard.

#### [](<>)Stokfella

[StokFella](https://stokfella.com/) is an app that makes it easier for stokvels to manage their admin, monthly payments, and claims. If you are part of a stokvel, you can leverage this app to make managing your stokvel much easier.

#### [](<>)Easy Equities

[Easy Equities](https://easyidentity.io/register/country?productid=easyequities&affiliateid=1&affiliatekey=Edg9nShh1wutEe8H7am42+2tXNhBHNOoGfbfs16j+j/zbQCphh6wlSS7MWAUSZYKvPv52gJDHLRiHI6mbyrsYwtf+I14S0yo9ZmRZUkZGdpZDXGbAybXY0qiPGezxplA) is an online platform that allows anyone to buy shares in a variety of stock markets, such as the JSE (South Africa), NYSE (America), and ASX (Australia). Easy Equities makes investing easy by having no minimums and very low fees, meaning you can invest with as little as R5. If you have R5 laying around, give it a spin.

#### [](<>)FedGroup

Diversifying your portfolio includes investing in different assets. You do this so that if something happens to some of your assets, you have many others to fall back on. An alternative investment you could consider is impact farming. [FedGroup'](https://www.fedgroup.co.za/)s impact farming allows you to own a stake in farming ventures such as beehives and blueberry bushes that generate income. You can access these investments effortlessly via the FedGroup mobile app.

#### [](<>)LiveStockWealth

[LiveStockWealth](https://livestockwealth.com/) is a crowdfarming platform. Crowdfarming is a simple way to help anyone buy and own profit-earning assets while assisting farmers to grow and maintain crops and livestock until they are ready to be sold. For example, you could invest in the care of a pregnant cow, and make a profit from the sale of the calf.

I hope you benefit from these apps, and that they make managing and making money for you easier. Till next time, enjoy your personal finance journey.
