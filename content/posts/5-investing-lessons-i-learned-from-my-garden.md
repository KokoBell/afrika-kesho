## Patience is the biggest part of investing

When you're investing, sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all — and that's okay.

There are many lessons I learned from gardening that have helped me become a better investor. One of those lessons is patience: Patience is the biggest part of investing. You will have ups and downs along the way, but if you stick with it long enough and let your investments grow, you'll be rewarded for your faith in them.

## Take care of your soil, and it will take care of you

Your garden will thrive if you take care of your soil. It’s a simple concept: the medium in which your plants grow provides the foundation for growth. In terms of investing, the soil is your research. The more thorough and detailed your research, the stronger your foundation will be, allowing you to create a better investment strategy with less risk than others who skim through their research or skip it altogether.

Investing is no different than gardening in this respect—the more time and effort you put into researching companies, management teams and competitors before making an investment decision (and then sticking with that decision over time), the better results you’ll see from them over time as well.

There are two main types of analysis: technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Technical analysis involves analysing price movements over time to find patterns; fundamental analysis looks at company financials (earnings per share), management team assessments, competitor information and market trends so that investors can make informed decisions about whether or not they want to invest in these companies based on their own goals for those investments

## Weed the garden before it gets out of control

> Weed the garden before it gets out of control.

I'm sure you've heard this analogy before, but I've found that it applies perfectly to investing. Just like having a healthy and productive garden requires regular maintenance and upkeep, your investment portfolio should be constantly being inspected and updated as well. This can mean revisiting your strategy once a year or more often if you're feeling like there's something off with how things are going in the market. It could also mean selling assets that have slipped in quality over time, or checking up on what new opportunities are available for purchase. Whatever you decide to do however, make sure that at least once every few months (or even better yet every month) when you look over your investment plans and investments themselves, it becomes part of an ongoing process rather than just one day per year where everything goes through an annual review process as well.

## Harvest when the time is right

Another important lesson to be learned from gardening is when to harvest your crop.

Harvesting the right fruit at the right time is essential for getting the most out of your garden. If you harvest too early, then you won’t be able to make use of that fruit later in the season and may lose out on a valuable crop. If you wait until too late, then your crop will spoil or be damaged by weather conditions and pests, resulting in wasted work and lost revenue.

It's no different with investing: if you don't sell at just the right moment, then you could end up leaving money on the table—or worse yet, losing everything! The key here is knowing when it's time to move on from an investment so that it doesn't drag down future earnings potentials while still providing some benefits along with its current gains

## Your health is important

My garden has taught me that your health is important. It is a big part of everything you do, including investing. You can't neglect your health and expect to have a good life or investment strategy.

Your family's health also matters, as well as yours. Don't neglect your own health, or that of your financial situation, either! And don’t forget about physical fitness (eating right), mental fitness (going out in nature), and taking care of yourself in general—these are all vital elements to living happily and investing successfully over time.

At times when I found myself neglecting my mental health—or even just feeling stressed out—the garden would reflect this in its appearance: the plants were growing poorly or dying off rapidly!

## Gardening taught me many lessons about investing

Gardening is a great way to learn about investing. While there are many similarities between investing and gardening, the biggest lesson I learned is that patience is the best investment strategy.

You can’t expect your garden to be perfect right away, or even in one season. It takes time for plants to grow, flowers to blossom and fruits to ripen. You need patience when it comes time for those fruits—just like you need patience when waiting for your investments (or gardens) to mature into something more valuable than they were in their initial form.

It's also important not to rush these processes too much. If you've been watering regularly but don't see any results after a while, it may be time for an additional watering or fertilizing treatment! Likewise if you've been picking at weeds but they keep coming back--it could be because there's still some moisture left in the soil or because there are other weeds nearby competing with your crops for nutrients!
