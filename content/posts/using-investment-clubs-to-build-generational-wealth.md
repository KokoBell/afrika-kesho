There’s a saying that goes - “If you want to go fast, go alone… if you want to go far, go with others.” This is also true for investing, if you want to build generational wealth fast then investment clubs might just be for you. But what is an investment club?

# [](<>)The “what” of it all

When a group of people learn about investments, combine their money, and then make investments using the combined money - that is an investment club. The club can invest in any asset of their choosing, from shares to whole businesses, from livestock to crops, all the way to property and crypto.

Another feature of an investment club is that the members of the club decide on the process for selecting which investments to buy and sell together. The members can meet regularly for updates, decision-making and learning from one another.

I would consider stokvels a great example of investment clubs because they pool their funds for specific purposes and meet regularly.

# [](<>)Why start an Investment Club?

There are a number of reasons for you to start an investment club. For example, if you and 14 friends contributed R1000 a month for one year, you’ll have R180 000 - it would be more if you kept it in a savings account with interest. That’s enough to fund a chain of two or three small spazas that will give you income. The club could re-invest the profits to grow the spazas into retail stores, or to expand by opening up other spazas in different locations.

An important thing to consider before you start an investment club is: what is the goal of the investment club? If you can answer this clearly, then you can invite people with similar goals to form an investment club, it's important to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Alternatively, if you are already part of a stokvel or a similar arrangement, discuss with your members what the goal of the current group is, and if that goal can be refined further.

Knowing the goal of the investment club will help you make sure that you’ve chosen the correct investment strategy. If your goals are short term (3 years or less), and they need cash, then your investment club can open a bank account, since a savings account is all you would need. If your goals rely on growth and dividends, then you open a brokerage account - either way, the types of accounts must be in line with investment strategy. The investment strategy should include:

* How often the investment club buys and sells assets
* What the asset allocation is
* Which specific assets to buy and sell
* Under what conditions are assets sold

Some banks or funds have lower fees for larger sums, so you can save on costs when you pool money and invest in large sums. You can also learn a lot about investment clubs by being part of one. An investment club runs efficiently and profitably when everyone understands what is going on and adds value during group discussions. As such, the members who know more about investments should ensure that the other members have enough knowledge to contribute meaningfully. The internet has countless resources for learning; all you need is wifi or data.

# [](<>)The nitty gritty

Once you’ve gathered friends, family and acquaintances, and everybody understands what the goal of the investment club is - then it’s time to dive into the administration of the club. Nailing this part means operations should run smoothly once everything is set up.

Here are some steps to look at in the administration:

1. **Name the club**: The name should reflect the goal of the club, or the characteristics of the members, or any other aspect relevant to the investment club. The name should be agreed to by all the club members.
2. **Draft a constitution**: The more thorough the constitution of the investment club is then the less awkward moments there will be during operations. Ensure that everyone contributes, and that the constitution accounts for as many scenarios as possible.
3. **Elect an executive committee**: This is where members vote for and appoint the Chairperson, Secretary, Treasury and any other executive roles that might be needed for the club. Be clear on what the responsibilities of each executive and member are.
4. **Open a bank account for the club**: The Chairperson, Treasury and Secretary will be responsible for this process. They are known as the authorized signatories, and their FICA documents will be required by the bank.
5. **Activate the bank account**: the investment club’s bank account will be activated when the first deposit is made.

At this point you’re ready to start saving and investing. If the club includes the stock market as part of their investment strategy, then an extra step would be to open a brokerage account. Otherwise, follow the due process for whichever assets the club intends to invest in.

# [](<>)Let’s talk about the constitution

The constitution of an investment club is a document that is easily understood by all members, it dictates how the club members should engage with other members and how the club will run. It should cover all aspects, including how to join the club, how to leave the club, how much the joining fee is (if there is any) and the investment club’s investment strategy and so on.

As members of the same investment club, you may have similar goals but different ideas on achieving those same goals. The constitution needs to be drafted and signed by all investment club members to account for these differences and other differences such as the risk appetite of each club member. While drafting the constitution, discuss all situations you can imagine, including difficult situations, so that when times get tough, everyone is on level ground because you act according to the constitution you all signed. Examples of situations to cover are when someone wants to contribute more money, when someone has to stop contributing for a while, or when a person would like to withdraw from the club.

The constitution must rule on how the club is investing, and the person responsible for executing the investment (Chair or Treasury) must act according to the Investment Club Constitution and not personal preference.
