Have you ever wondered about how some people can get the best of both worlds? They always look stunning, and their wallet seems like it’s never empty - at the same time! Let me tell you the secret sauce: *thrifting*.

Unfortunately thrifting can get overwhelming, especially if you're not experienced. Rummaging through hundreds of clothes to find one item is not for the faint-hearted but luckily for you I've got some tips to help you get started (or improve) your thrifting journey.

## Preparation

* Wear comfortable, fitted clothes and shoes you can easily slip out of. Some thrift stores don't have dressing rooms so you have to be able to try the clothes on top of what you're already wearing.
* Carry physical cash, especially small notes. Most thrift stores only accept cash as payment so having small notes makes the transactions quick and efficient.
* Keep your cash somewhere that's safe and secure but easy for you to access. If you thrift in the streets like I do then this tip is essential.
* Create a list of the clothing you're looking for. Having a list gives you direction and prevents costly distractions. Keep your list short - two to four items at a time is a good number.

## Thrifting

* Reference your list as you shop. Look for any colours, patterns, styles or materials that catch your eye. This cuts your thrifting time down and reduces your chance to impulse buy.
* Take your time. Thoroughly check the quality of each piece of clothing that you want to buy. Look for any holes, tears, stains, loose thread or discoloration. You want the best quality for your money.
* Try it on over what you're wearing. If the clothing item passes the above step then try it on. Trying the item is important because you need to know whether it fits and how the material feels when it's on your body.
* Don’t be afraid to buy bigger items because you can always get the clothes altered.
* Opt for materials that age well. These are materials such as leather, silk, hemp, denim or cotton. If you thrift items made from these materials they'll just get better with time.
* Thrift with a friend and make it fun! It's way easier to shop all day when you're having fun.

## Styling and Wearing

* Once you’ve brought clothes home, always wash them before you wear them.
* Alter any clothing that doesn't fit well. Getting your clothes altered is crucial to looking well put-together regardless of your clothes being thrifted or store bought.
* Consider re-purposing any regret purchases. Maybe you hate the way that patterned shirt looks on you, so why not wear it as a head scarf? Or maybe it looks better if you wear it as a skirt? Get creative in the way you use your clothes.
* Don't forget to add accessories to your outfit. Accessories bring an outfit together. Keep an eye out for belts, bags and jewelry when you're out thrifting.

I used to be overwhelmed by thrifting until I implemented these tips. Now it's my favourite thing to do and the best part of thrifting is that no one will have the exact same outfit as me.
